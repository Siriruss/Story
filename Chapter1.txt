Executive Summary
The penetration test carried out on the Dojo Scavenger environment within the designated training VM spanned one week. The core objective was to discover vulnerabilities and retrieve up to 19 keys patterned after "1dcca23355272056f04fe8bf20edfce0". Tools like Nikto and OWASP Zed Attack Proxy were employed to initiate and enumerate vulnerabilities, revealing various potential attack vectors including Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, and Operating System Command Injection. After identifying these vulnerabilities, exploitation strategies were devised, leading to several key discoveries. In addition to these vulnerabilities, the tester made an in-depth investigation into the key generation methodology, concluding that the keys were generated through a sequence, increasing by a consistent value, and then hashed with the MD5 algorithm.

Over the course of a week, our penetration testing team rigorously assessed the Dojo Scavenger environment within the specified training VM. This was guided by our objective to unearth vulnerabilities and obtain up to 19 distinct cryptographic keys in the format "1dcca23355272056f04fe8bf20edfce0".
To start, the Nikto web server scanner was employed to provide an initial overview of possible vulnerabilities in the web application. This flagged a visible robots.txt file and allowed HTTP Methods as areas of interest. The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) was then used to provide a more granular analysis, revealing potential attack vectors such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), and Operating System Command Injection.
Following this enumeration phase, the exploitation process involved manual and tool-assisted techniques. Prominent among the tools utilized were Burp Suite, sqlmap, and CyberChef. These tools and techniques exposed various vulnerabilities, including but not limited to backup files, information leakage from source code comments, and improper server configurations. An exploration into key generation methodology revealed that the keys were sequentially derived using a mathematical formula, followed by MD5 hashing.

Scope of Work
This penetration test focuses exclusively on the Dojo Scavenger environment within the designated training VM. Over a period of one week, the tester was tasked with identifying vulnerabilities and collecting up to 19 distinct keys, resembling the format "1dcca23355272056f04fe8bf20edfce0". The primary aim is to understand the vulnerabilities allowing for key discovery, ensuring that other environments are strictly out-of-scope. Upon test completion, findings were to be systematically reported, highlighting vulnerabilities, discovered keys, and security enhancement recommendations. As a bonus objective, the tester was encouraged to determine the methodology behind key generation and, if possible, predict subsequent keys in the sequence.
Project Objectives
The primary objective of this penetration test is to:
•	Identify vulnerabilities in the Dojo Scavenger environment.
•	Collect up to 19 potential keys, which will be in the format: "1dcca23355272056f04fe8bf20edfce0".
•	Understand the nature of vulnerabilities that enabled key discovery.
•	Provide recommendations for addressing the identified issues securely.
•	Determine the method used to generate the keys and predict potential subsequent keys.

Recommendations
Our comprehensive penetration test of the application revealed multiple security lapses that have the potential to be exploited by adversaries, compromising the application's security posture. Central to the vulnerabilities found were:
1.	HTTP Methods & Headers: The application allowed the use of arbitrary HTTP methods such as 'SAMPLE' and displayed non-standard headers that leaked sensitive data. It's imperative to restrict the use of non-standard HTTP methods and eliminate unnecessary custom headers.
2.	Cookie & Session Management: We noted predictable cookie generation processes that can be easily exploited. A shift to cryptographically secure algorithms for session management is crucial.
3.	Insecure Coding Practices: Several keys were exposed due to insecure coding habits like embedding sensitive information in HTML comments, forms, and meta tags. Regular code reviews to identify and rectify such practices are essential.
4.	Parameter Tampering & Injection Vulnerabilities: The application was susceptible to web parameter tampering and both command and SQL injection. These vulnerabilities underscore the need for strong server-side validation of all parameters, rigorous input sanitization, and the use of parameterized queries.
5.	Data Storage & Access: Our test uncovered plaintext password storage, weak administrative credentials, and exposed sensitive files like robots.txt and crossdomain.xml. Implementing strong cryptographic password hashing and limiting unnecessary file exposures are immediate measures that need adoption.
By addressing these highlighted areas, the application can substantially fortify its security defenses, ensuring resilience against cyber threats.

Methodology
Enumeration
To begin enumeration the tester utilized Nikto, an open-source web server scanner, to scan the web application for potential vulnerabilities. This scan noted several potential vulnerabilities that were to be further explored throughout the penetration test. Things of immediate note were the confirmation that the application had a viewable robots.txt file as well as a visible key within the allowed HTTP Methods.
 
Figure 1 Initial Nikto Scan of the Web Application
The tester then ran a scan on the target application using OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). The results from the initial scan showed several potential vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities included Cross Site Scripting, SQL Injection, and Operating System Command Injection. The OWASP ZAP program was able to provide the potentially vulnerability and the location on the web application that may be exploited using the specified vulnerability.
 
Figure 2 OWASP ZAP Initial Vulnerability Scan
The Tester followed the initial scan by performing a forced browsing scan using the same OWASP ZAP program. The intention of this scan was to discover the file structure of the web application as well as any hidden directories or files that may contain sensitive information or create a vulnerability within the web application. This scan showed several directories and files that were not initially present on the basic scan. New directories of note included the crack and services directories.
 
Figure 3 OWASP ZAP Forced Browsing Results

Having seen indications of a robots.txt file in results from both scanners the tester attempted to navigate to the file through the browser. The browser returned the contents of the robots.txt file which showed that there was an unlisted admin page as well as an additional key.
 
Figure 4 Robots.txt file contents

The tester then began a basic analysis of each available webpage within the application and the HTML code connected to the webpages. Immediately the tester found a key within a META tag in the head of the index page. Further analysis of the home page HTML showed an additional key hidden in a comment as part of the navigation bar. 
 
Figure 5 Key Found Within META tag on home page
  
Figure 6 Key found within comment on home page

Moving to other pages within the application the tester found additional keys within a comment in the form on the contact us page and as a value within a form on the support page of the application.
 
Figure 7 Key found within a comment in form on Contact Us page
  
Figure 8 Key found as value within from on support page

Reviewing the results from the Nikto and OWASP ZAP scans the tester noted the presence of a file called crossdomain.xml. Files with a name like this are frequently used to grant a web client permission to handle data across multiple domains. Navigating to this file through the URL displayed another key as well as policy information on what domain have access to the application.
 
Figure 9 Crossdomain.xml File Showing an Additional Key

Exploitation
Following the information gathered by looking at the robots.txt file, the tester navigated to the hidden admin page which displayed a login prompt for an administrator account.
 
Figure 10 Admin Login Page

Attempting to login to the admin page with random username and password rerouted the tester back to the login page with an additional parameter in the URL showing another key.
 
Figure 11 Admin Login Page After Attempted Login

Utilizing Burp suite, a security application used for penetration testing of web applications, the tester was able to capture the request for an attempted login to the admin page. The request showed the tester that the parameters were visible in the request leading the tester to utilize the Intruder functionality of Burp suite to attempt to brute force the login credentials for the admin page.
 
Figure 12 Request Showing Attempted Login to Admin Page

The Intruder feature was able to successfully identify the correct password “abc123” for the admin account with the addition of the common username “admin” supplied by the tester. Due to the login attempts always routing back the login page regardless of the success of the login attempt the tester had to sort the request results by length to determine if any of the results returned different information, likely a signal that it was a successful login attempt.
 
Figure 13 Burp Intruder Discovering Password by Response Content Length

Using the new login credentials the tester was able to login to the admin page which displayed another hidden key.
 
Figure 14 Page Displayed Upon Login to Admin Page
The next step the tester took was to return to the initial vulnerability scans to determine the next vulnerability to test. Seeing the number of allowed HTTP methods, coupled with the knowledge that a custom method was added, the tester began to make calls to the web application to determine if there would be any unexpected or new responses or functionality generated. 
 
Figure 15 Allowed HTTP Methods

During the testing it was noted that when utilizing the SAMPLE HTTP method, the application would return a response containing an unfamiliar header called X-Sample. 
Figure 16 Request and Response Using the SAMLE Method

After doing research on the unusual header the tester learned that the headers are generally used for non-standard or proprietary add-ons to the header fields.
 
Figure 17 Description of X-Headers

Studying the X-Sample header the tester realized that it was like a base64 encoded string due to the equals sign at the end of the string denoting additional padding due to the original string not being a multiple of 3 bytes. To verify the tester inserted the string into a hash analyzer.

 
Figure 18 Hash Analysis of Suspected Base64 String
Using CyberChef, a web app for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis, the tester was able to decode the base64 string to reveal another key.
 
Figure 19 Cyber Chef Decoding X-Header Key

Utilizing the OWASP Testing Framework the tester began looking for potential backup files contained within the web application that were not properly deleted, secured, or forgot about.
 
Figure 20 OWASP Testing Methodology for Hidden Backups
The tester began this process by wordlist to use with Burp Intruder. This wordlist contained the possible extensions as outlined in the OWASP Testing Framework in multiple different variations.
 
Figure 21 Wordlist Used to Look for Hidden Backups
After selecting the file extension as the target for the Burp Intruder attack the tester ran the attack against each visible webpage within the application until it was discovered that the index.php (home page) had a backup stored within the file structure of the web application. It also appeared that the index.php~ backup file was larger than the current homepage suggesting that it may contain additional data or information.

 
Figure 22 Burp Intruder Results for Backups of Index.php

Navigating to the backup file and inspecting its HTML the tester discovered valuable information on how the web application functioned regarding the issuance of cookie headers. The tester determined that the application would randomly select a number between 1-9 and if the number was 1 then it would display a key as the cookie header but if it was any other number the application would display a random MD5 hash.

 
Figure 23 PHP Code Commented Out of Backup Index File Showing Cookie Generation

Knowing that the new cookie header would be set each time a user navigated to the home page the tester began refreshing the home page to receive the cookie header that was the key. After over 100 refreshes the tester received the key in the cookie header as expected.
 
Figure 24 Cookie Containing Key
Returning to the potential vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP ZAP scan the tester began to look at the partners page for potential SQL Injection. Initial manual testing of the form did not prove especially fruitful due to a developmental error that allows the form to be submitted with no real input and still authenticate the tester.
 
Figure 25 POST Request to Partners Page Allowing Authentication
Knowing that SQL Injection was likely possible the tester attempted to utilize a program called sqlmap, an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws, to try and gain access to any vulnerable database rows or tables. Using the below command the tester was able to retrieve a list of databases used by the web application. 
Figure 26 Code Snippet Used to Retrieve Databases
 
Figure 27 sqlmap Results with List of Databases
Seeing the list of databases, the tester was able to determine that the “samurai_dojo_scavenger” will be the most likely database to target for the remaining sqlmap attacks. The next step taken was to attempt to dump all data from the selected database to see what sensitive information it contained. After performing the database dump the tester discovered another key as well as login information (username=key, password=boomerang) that could possibly contain another key as well.
 
Figure 28 sqlmap Command to Dump Database Contents
 
Figure 29 Dumped Credentials from Parteners_Data
The tester navigated to the partners page and attempted to log in with the newfound credentials for the “key” account. These credentials logged the tester in and displayed a special message showing another key. The tester utilized all found credential, but no other credential displayed any additional keys.
 
Figure 30 Partners Page After Successful Login
Returning to the list of potential vulnerabilities the tester began to examine the potential Operating System Command Injection on the contactus.php webpage. Utilizing a slightly modified version of the input that was used by the OWASP ZAP program the tester was able to determine the vulnerable field within the form and submit a command to view the directory of the vulnerable web application.

 
Figure 31 Command to LS the Application Directory
 
Figure 32 Contents of the Web Application
The tester then used the command injection vulnerability to view the contents of the crack directory and discovered that it contained a php file that likely contained another key. Navigating to that file location showed the tester the key.
 
Figure 33 Using Command Injection to LS the crack Directory
 
Figure 34 Contents of the Key11.php File
 

Key Generation
To try and understand the methodology used to generate the keys the tester began by examining all the keys to see if there were any matching or common information throughout the sequence of keys. This did not provide the tester with any useful information but reminded the tester of the commented code found on the backup index page that stated that if the random number generated did not equal “1” the cookie would be a random MD5 hash. 
 
Figure 35 Commented Code Stating To Generate Random MD5 Hash
The tester then took several the discovered keys and decrypted them using online tools. After decrypting 4 of the keys the tester found that each key was a simple number and decrypting sequential keys showed the numbers were increasing at some set interval.
 
Figure 36 Decryption of Keys Using MD5 Decryption Tool
Using another online website, the tester was able to determine the greatest common denominator between the number to determine that each keys true value was being increase by the number 42.
 
Figure 37 Greatest Common Factor of Decrypted Keys
This information allowed the tester to confirm that each key is generated by taking the key number multiplied by 42 and then hashing that number using the MD5 hashing algorithm. That means that the next number in the sequence given that the last key is number 19 and the next key would be number 20 would equal 840 (20 x 42 = 840) and in the terms of hash value would equal key20=fa83a11a198d5a7f0bf77a1987bcd006.

Remediation: Implement multi-factor authentication for critical or admin interfaces. Strengthen password policies to ensure they meet a minimum length, complexity, and include a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols. Regularly update and audit passwords and avoid using default or easily guessable credentials.
________________________________________
Vulnerable HTTP Methods
Impact: Allowing unnecessary HTTP methods can give attackers the ability to exploit various web application vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This could compromise application integrity and user data.
Remediation: Disable any unused or non-standard HTTP methods on the server. Ensure only necessary methods like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE are enabled, and regularly review configurations to enforce this policy.
________________________________________
Cross Site Scripting
Impact: Attackers can exploit XSS vulnerabilities to execute malicious scripts in a user's browser. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the web application, or spreading malware to users.
Remediation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs rigorously. Use output encoding libraries to ensure any content rendered to users is safe and does not execute unintentionally. Implement content security policies that restrict script sources.
________________________________________
Operating System Command Injection
Impact: By injecting OS commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host system. This could compromise the entire server, lead to data breaches, and potentially use the server for malicious activities.
Remediation: Validate, whitelist, and sanitize all inputs rigorously. Never directly concatenate or include untrusted input in OS commands. Employ least privilege principles on the server and the web application's runtime environment.
________________________________________
Exposed Robots.txt File
Impact: A publicly accessible robots.txt can provide attackers with a roadmap to potentially sensitive areas of the web application. While not directly a vulnerability, it aids attackers in identifying attack vectors.
Remediation: Only use the robots.txt file for search engine indexing instructions. Do not rely on it to hide sensitive application paths. Ensure sensitive areas are protected with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
________________________________________
Exposed crossdomain.xml File
Impact: Revealing the crossdomain.xml file might allow attackers to understand which external domains are trusted, potentially enabling data theft or unauthorized API calls if combined with other vulnerabilities.
Remediation: Limit domains specified in the crossdomain.xml file. If not in use, remove the file. Ensure CORS policies are in place to restrict unexpected cross-domain requests.
________________________________________
SQL Injection
Impact: Attackers exploiting SQL injection can read, modify, or delete data in the database. They might also gain administrative privileges on the database, or in severe cases, execute commands on the host operating system.
Remediation: Utilize parameterized queries or ORM tools for database operations. Sanitize and validate all user inputs rigorously. Ensure the application's database user has minimum necessary privileges.
________________________________________
Insecure Coding Practices
Impact: By leaving sensitive information within HTML comments, attackers gain insights into the application's inner workings, potentially revealing vulnerabilities or sensitive application logic.
Remediation: Establish a secure coding guideline that prohibits leaving sensitive information or unnecessary comments in code. Implement regular code reviews and automated scanning tools to detect such issues.
________________________________________
Forgotten Backup Files
Impact: Backup files can provide attackers with older versions of application code, potentially revealing vulnerabilities that have since been patched or showing critical application logic.
Remediation: Regularly audit the web server's directories. Ensure backup files, if kept, are stored outside of web-accessible directories or are properly protected.
________________________________________
Web Parameter Tampering
Impact: Exposing URL parameters can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, bypass certain restrictions, or even retrieve sensitive data they shouldn't access.
Remediation: Implement strong server-side validation for all parameters. Encrypt or encode parameters when necessary and avoid revealing sensitive information through them.
________________________________________
Use of Sensitive Non-Standard Headers
Impact: Custom headers that reveal sensitive information can provide attackers with insights into potential vulnerabilities or application details that can be exploited.
Remediation: Regularly audit and review server configurations to ensure headers do not disclose sensitive information. Remove or restrict any unnecessary custom headers.
________________________________________
Weak Encryption and Hashing Algorithm Use
Impact: Weak encryption can be broken with modern tools, exposing sensitive data to attackers. Once decrypted, data integrity and confidentiality are compromised.
Remediation: Implement up-to-date, industry-accepted encryption, and hashing algorithms. Regularly review and update cryptographic methods to ensure they are in line with current best practices.

Missing X-Frame-Options Header
Impact: Without this header, attackers can potentially use a technique called "clickjacking" where malicious content overlays the legitimate page, tricking users into performing undesired actions.
Remediation: Implement the X-Frame-Options header and set it to 'SAMEORIGIN' or 'DENY' depending on the application's requirement.
________________________________________
Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header
Impact: Without this header, attackers can perform MIME type sniffing attacks, which might lead to the execution of malicious content in the context of the web application.
Remediation: Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' to prevent MIME type sniffing by browsers.
________________________________________
Cookie No HTTPOnly Flag
Impact: A cookie without the HttpOnly flag is accessible via JavaScript. If an XSS vulnerability exists, attackers could steal this cookie and potentially hijack user sessions.
Remediation: Ensure all cookies, especially session cookies, have the HttpOnly flag set, preventing them from being accessed via JavaScript.
________________________________________
Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled
Impact: Without this browser-level protection, the application relies solely on its own defenses against XSS, increasing the risk of successful XSS attacks.
Remediation: Enable Web Browser XSS Protection by setting the appropriate HTTP header. Also, ensure that the application has robust defenses against XSS at the code level.
________________________________________
Password Field with Autocomplete Enabled
Impact: Autocompleted passwords can be easily accessed by attackers who compromise the user's machine or through cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This risks unauthorized access and potential breaches.
Remediation: Ensure that the autocomplete attribute is set to "off" for password fields and other sensitive data inputs in the web application.
